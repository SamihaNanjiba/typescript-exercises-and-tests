// Create a function addClickListener() that adds a click event listener to a specified HTML element. When clicked, it should log "Element clicked!" to the console.

// Create a custom event called "statusUpdate" that can be dispatched on any HTML element. When dispatched, it should log "Status updated!" to the console.

// Create an HTML structure with nested elements (e.g., a div inside a div). Add click event listeners to both the parent and child elements. When clicked, each element should log its tag name to the console.

// Create an unordered list (<ul>) with multiple list items (<li>). Add a click event listener to the list (<ul>) and handle the click event by logging the text content of the clicked list item (<li>).

// Create an HTML input element (e.g., <input type="text">). Add multiple event listeners for the input event that perform different actions (e.g., logging the input value, changing the background color of the input field).

// Create a nested structure of HTML elements with event listeners attached to each level (e.g., div > section > button). Click on the innermost button and observe the order in which event listeners are triggered due to event bubbling.

// Implement an Event Emitter class that allows registering event listeners for custom events and emitting those events with optional data. Ensure that listeners are invoked asynchronously to mimic the browser's event handling behavior.

// Implement a drag and drop functionality using native JavaScript event handling. Create draggable elements and drop targets on an HTML page. Implement event listeners for mouse events (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup) to handle dragging and dropping of elements.

// Implement an Event Bus pattern that acts as a central communication hub for different parts of an application. Components can subscribe to specific events and publish events with optional data. Ensure that components can communicate effectively through the event bus.

// Implement event handling functionality that works consistently across different web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Identify and handle any browser-specific quirks or differences in event handling behavior to ensure a consistent user experience.
